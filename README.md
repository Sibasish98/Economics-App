# Economics-App

This is a very simple app, in which user needs to enter a demand equation,supply equation, price ceil, price floor, tax amount and the application would display the analysis upon that. '
**Note:**





1> The both equation must be in exact format as d[s]d'p'   ,  where d is any number, s is for either + or -, and again a d (another number) followed by a lower case 'p' letter denoting the price varibale. For example:



20+5p ✅ Valid



20+5P ❌ Invalid



5p+20 ❌ Invalid



123-20p ✅ Valid



**2> None of the field should be empty ! If its empty it may led to unexpected behaviour like crashing, expections are not handled
